When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my content to others or reach my commits from multiple hosts.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I want to control which version will be in remote repo. So there is no needless network congestion and shared contents are kept clean.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch: you can start or introduce a new feature gradually with branching
    Clones: you make a copy that can be pushed back to the original repository
    Forks: this copy of repository is separated from the original, you use this kind of clone when you have not got the proper access priviledges or want to avoid making changes in original repo

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
